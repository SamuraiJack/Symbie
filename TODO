TASKS
=====

Infrastructure
--------------




Configuration
-------------

- configuration parameteres for Application, which will specify traits/roles for key system components like router and context
- configuration framework.. like Bread::Board, and Switch Symbie to it?



Routes
------

- do not allow add tokens after wildcard token
- checks for routes ambiguity
- inheritance of internal details for routes (just MutableCopy or each route as class)?


Unsort
------

- implement sequencing of dispatching (several calls to dispatch should be processed one-by-one) 
- any container should be able to dispatch (even used as non-widget and w/o ID etc)
- do not remember the token after exception in dispatch

- combine Application, Router, RootWidget logic somehow 


DONE
====


- create Task/ package to speedup the loading
- Symbie.ID role (for widget and application)
- url for route instance (route.toString(parameters)
